# PAYDAY 2 | Infamy Rebalance
English | [Russian](https://github.com/SparkVRX/PD2-Infamy-Rebalance/blob/main/README_RU.md)

The Infamy system in **PAYDAY 2** was originally intended to be an incentive to continue playing, but it ended up being its biggest flaw. This is because leveling takes too long, only a few contracts are good for it, and 400 out of 500 levels give you nothing at all. But the biggest problem with this system is that it doesn't allow you to level effectively just by playing for fun. Instead, you have to grind - repeating the same contracts in a circle.

This mod solves all these problems. It completely revises the Infamy system, bringing it closer to the Renown system in PAYDAY 3. Now it works exactly as it should: it gives you motivation to continue playing, allows you to play without grinding and for fun, and also serves as a kind of measure of how much you play. Play, not grind.

Among other things, the mod makes the game's economy really interesting, preventing money from becoming worthless in the later stages of the game. This is achieved by dynamically paying for each Infamy level. This mod also makes sense of Crime Spree, because now the experience received as a reward will increase Infamy by as many levels as it is enough for, and will not burn out.

## Experience
The Infamy leveling system has been changed to allow you to level up while having fun.
* Leveling up with the Infamy pool now requires 6 000 000 experience instead of 30 000 000.
* No more leveling up via reputation reset.
	* If you have at least 1 Infamy level, then further leveling will only be possible with the Infamy pool.
	* If you do not have Infamy yet, then to reach level 1 you will have to reset your reputation, but only this time.

## Economy
The Infamy leveling fees have been completely overhauled to add more interest to leveling and improve the game's economy.
* Now you pay 200 000 000 offshore money just for the 1-st Infamy level.
* For all other Infamy levels (2-500) you pay 80% of your cash and offshore money, but not more than 6 000 000 cash and 24 000 000 offshore.

**Example 1**  
You have 3 000 000 cash and 20 000 000 offshore money in your account.  
To increase the Infamy level, you will pay 2 400 000 cash and 16 000 000 offshore money.  
In other words, you will pay 80% of your account.

**Example 2**  
You have 600 000 cash and 6 000 000 offshore money in your account.  
To increase the Infamy level, you will pay 480 000 cash and 4 800 000 offshore money.  
In other words, you will pay 80% of your account.

**Example 3**  
You have 50 000 000 cash and 300 000 000 offshore money in your account.  
To increase the Infamy level, you will pay 6 000 000 cash and 24 000 000 offshore.  
In other words, you will pay the maximum cost of the Infamy level, since 80% of your account is more than the maximum cost.

**Example 4**  
You have 0 cash and 0 offshore money in your account.  
You will not pay anything to increase the Infamy level, since 80% of 0 is 0.  
In other words, you will increase the Infamy level for free.

## Crime Spree
Do you also find Crime Spree an interesting mode, but don't see the point in playing it? The mod solves this problem too.
* If you received enough experience as a reward for Crime Spree to increase Infamy by 2 or more levels, the increase will occur automatically. In this case, the fee for each level will be calculated according to the logic described above.
* If the experience gained from Crime Spree is only enough for 1 Infamy level or less, nothing will happen except for replenishing the Infamy pool.

**Example 1**  
You have 0 of 6 000 000 experience in your Infamy pool. You have 13 000 000 experience as a reward for Crime Spree.  
When you receive the reward, you will automatically receive 2 Infamy levels.

**Example 2**  
You have 0 of 6 000 000 experience in your Infamy pool. You have 25 000 000 experience as a reward for Crime Spree.  
When you receive the reward, you will automatically receive 4 Infamy levels.

**Example 3**  
You have 6 000 000 of 6 000 000 experience in your Infamy pool. You have 25 000 000 experience as a reward for Crime Spree.  
When you receive the reward, you will automatically receive 5 Infamy levels.

**Example 4**  
You have 3 000 000 of 6 000 000 experience in your Infamy pool. You have 8 000 000 experience as a reward for Crime Spree.  
When you receive the reward, nothing will happen, only your Infamy pull will be filled - because the experience is not enough for at least 2 levels. There is no point in making an automatic increase only by 1 level, since you yourself can increase it in the Infamy menu.
